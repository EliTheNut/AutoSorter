# AutoSorter
A Python script that will automatically sort your files (and folders)



## About
I got this idea from a programmer on youtube but made it my own by making auto sorting abilities. The program works by taking any file or folder placed into an "organizing" file and moving it into another folder while organzing it by its type of file. PNGs will go into the PNG folder and PY files will go into the PY folder. It also accepts folders and moves them into the "_folder" directory. After starting the file it will run indefintely unless you send a terminal command to stop it. I have used Apple's automator to make the scripts into applications for my use. This should be able to be downloaded by anyone and work on your computer. 

**This program is set up to run on startup for me and doesn't take up much CPU.*
